# GETRADS - Uber for cross-border packages
**Ian Whitehouse**

## Overview
This is a Django prototype site, called GETRADS (I swear that stood for something) that I built for my friend, whose company was part of the American University incubator.  I remember it being pretty cool to build so maybe I'll have the chance to use Django again some time soon.
